This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has fully initialized. This often happens when calling `takePictureAsync` within the `useEffect` hook before the camera component has mounted and is ready to function properly.  The error will likely mention a null or undefined value related to the camera object.
